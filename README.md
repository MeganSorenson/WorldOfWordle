# **World of Wordle**

## **It's like Wordle, but on steroids.**

Like the original Wordle game, World of Wordle has the player trying to uncover a mystery 5-letter word 
in a limited amount of word guesses with feedback about the letters that were correct.

What makes World of Wordle different is the three difficulty levels that you can choose to play with:

- EASY gives the player 5 attempts to guess a single word
- MEDIUM gives the player 7 attempts to simultaneously guess 2 words 
- HARD gives the player 9 attempts to simultaneously guess 3 words


This will bring a new type of challenge for the *Wordle Champions* out there. On top of that, World of Wordle keeps 
track of the player's score and word guess streak so that the player can try to maximize them as they play.

## **Who can play?**

Anyone can play World of Wordle! The option to play an EASY game gives the somewhat typical functionality of the original Wordle, 
which is meant for the everyday person who loves word games. In addition to this, World of Wordle provides
the MEDIUM and HARD game options to attract the more skilled and practiced Wordle players out there.

## Why did I want to make World of Wordle?

As a commuting student at the University of British Columbia, I spend more time than I would really like to on the bus 
to school every morning. Not ready to do anything productive during that time, I often open up one of many of the word 
games on my smart phone. 

Wordle was a popular game over the past year or so, and I completed my fair share of daily word challenges on my daily
commutes. In transit, I would always hear people chat about who was the *Wordle CHAMPION of the day* in their 
respective group and it got me thinking.

I decided that I wanted to create a version of Wordle that would truly separate the Wordle *Players* from the 
Wordle *Champions*, and so came the idea for World of Wordle.
